## Dunder Methods

What Are Dunder Methods?

In Python, special methods are a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes. They are easy to recognize because they start and end with double underscores, for example __init__ or __str__.

As it quickly became tiresome to say under-under-method-under-under Pythonistas adopted the term “dunder methods”, a short form of “double under.”

These “dunders” or “special methods” in Python are also sometimes called “magic methods.” But using this terminology can make them seem more complicated than they really are—at the end of the day there’s nothing “magical” about them. You should treat these methods like a normal language feature.

## Iterators

Iterations are performed through 'for' and 'while' loops. Iterations execute a set of instructions repeatedly until some limiting criteria is met. A 'for' loop iterates over a sequence (such as a list, string, tuple and range). ... It terminates the loop when there is no element left in the sequence.

## Generators

Python provides a generator to create your own iterator function. A generator is a special type of function which does not return a single value, instead, it returns an iterator object with a sequence of values. In a generator function, a yield statement is used rather than a return statement.
