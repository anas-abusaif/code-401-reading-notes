# React 1

The smallest React example looks like this:

```
ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

## JSX

Why JSX?

React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.

Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both. We will come back to components in a further section, but if you’re not yet comfortable putting markup in JS, this talk might convince you otherwise.

React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.

With that out of the way, let’s get started!

## Rendering an Element into the DOM

Let’s say there is a `<div>` somewhere in your HTML file:

```
<div id="root"></div>
```

We call this a “root” DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM.

Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like.

To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to ReactDOM.render():

```
const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## Function and Class Components

The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:

```
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single “props” (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components “function components” because they are literally JavaScript functions.

You can also use an ES6 class to define a component:

```
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

The above two components are equivalent from React’s point of view.

## Handling Events

Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:

React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.
For example, the HTML:

```
<button onclick="activateLasers()">
  Activate Lasers
</button>
```

is slightly different in React:

```
<button onClick={activateLasers}>
  Activate Lasers
</button>
```

Another difference is that you cannot return false to prevent default behavior in React. You must call preventDefault explicitly. For example, with plain HTML, to prevent the default form behavior of submitting, you can write:

```
<form onsubmit="console.log('You clicked submit.'); return false">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

In React, this could instead be:

```
function Form() {
  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log('You clicked submit.');
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

# Tailwind CSS

A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

This approach allows us to implement a completely custom component design without writing a single line of custom CSS.

# Next.js

To build a complete web application with React from scratch, there are many important details you need to consider:

Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.

You need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.

You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.

You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.

A framework can solve these problems. But such a framework must have the right level of abstraction — otherwise it won’t be very useful. It also needs to have great "Developer Experience", ensuring you and your team have an amazing experience while writing code.

Next.js: The React Framework
Enter Next.js, the React Framework. Next.js provides a solution to all of the above problems. But more importantly, it puts you and your team in the pit of success when building React applications.

Next.js aims to have best-in-class developer experience and many built-in features, such as:

An intuitive page-based routing system (with support for dynamic routes)
Pre-rendering, both static generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) are supported on a per-page basis
Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
Client-side routing with optimized prefetching
Built-in CSS and Sass support, and support for any CSS-in-JS library
Development environment with Fast Refresh support
API routes to build API endpoints with Serverless Functions
Fully extendable
Next.js is used in tens of thousands of production-facing websites and web applications, including many of the world's largest brands.
