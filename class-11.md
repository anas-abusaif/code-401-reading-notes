# Data Analysis

## What is Jupyter Lab

JupyterLab enables you to arrange your work area with notebooks, text files, terminals, and notebook outputs. JupyterLab provides a high level of integration between notebooks, documents, and activities: Drag-and-drop to reorder notebook cells and copy them between notebooks.

JupyterLab also offers a unified model for viewing and handling data formats. JupyterLab understands many file formats (images, CSV, JSON, Markdown, PDF, Vega, Vega-Lite, etc.) and can also display rich kernel output in these formats. See File and Output Formats for more information.

## Numpy

NumPy is a commonly used Python data analysis package. By using NumPy, you can speed up your workflow, and interface with other packages in the Python ecosystem, like scikit-learn, that use NumPy under the hood. NumPy was originally developed in the mid 2000s, and arose from an even older package called Numeric. This longevity means that almost every data analysis or machine learning package for Python leverages NumPy in some way.

NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing those arrays. Using NumPy, mathematical and logical operations on arrays can be performed. NumPy is a Python package. It stands for 'Numerical Python'.
