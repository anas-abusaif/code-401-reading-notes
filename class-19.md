## Regular expression

Regular Expressions, often shortened as regex, are a sequence of characters used to check whether a pattern exists in a given text (string) or not. If you've ever used search engines, search and replace tools of word processors and text editors - you've already seen regular expressions in use. They are used at the server side to validate the format of email addresses or passwords during registration, used for parsing text data files to find, replace, or delete certain string, etc. They help in manipulating textual data, which is often a prerequisite for data science projects involving text mining.

You will start with importing re - Python library that supports regular expressions. Then you will see how basic/ordinary characters are used for performing matches, followed by wild or special characters. Next, you'll learn about using repetitions in your regular expressions. You'll also learn how to create groups and named groups within your search for ease of access to matches. Next, you'll get familiar with the concept of greedy vs. non-greedy matching.
