# Pandas

pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. It is free software released under the three-clause BSD license.

Started by Wes McKinney in 2008 out of a need for a powerful and flexible quantitative analysis tool, pandas has grown into one of the most popular Python libraries. It has an extremely active community of contributors.

Pandas DataFrame is two-dimensional size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns). A Data frame is a two-dimensional data structure, i.e., data is aligned in a tabular fashion in rows and columns.


pandas is one of the first Python packages you should learn because it's easy to use, open source, and will allow you to work with large quantities of data. It allows fast and efficient data manipulation, data aggregation and pivoting, flexible time series functionality, and more.
