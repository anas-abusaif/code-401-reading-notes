## Next.js

To build a complete web application with React from scratch, there are many important details you need to consider:

  * Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.
  * You need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.
  * You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.
  * You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.
A framework can solve these problems. But such a framework must have the right level of abstraction — otherwise it won’t be very useful. It also needs to have great "Developer Experience", ensuring you and your team have an amazing experience while writing code.

Next.js: The React Framework

Enter Next.js, the React Framework. Next.js provides a solution to all of the above problems. But more importantly, it puts you and your team in the pit of success when building React applications.

Next.js aims to have best-in-class developer experience and many built-in features, such as:

An intuitive page-based routing system (with support for dynamic routes)
Pre-rendering, both static generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) are supported on a per-page basis
Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
Client-side routing with optimized prefetching
Built-in CSS and Sass support, and support for any CSS-in-JS library
Development environment with Fast Refresh support
API routes to build API endpoints with Serverless Functions
Fully extendable
Next.js is used in tens of thousands of production-facing websites and web applications, including many of the world's largest brands.

## React Context for Beginners

What is React context?
React context allows us to pass down and use (consume) data in whatever component we need in our React app without using props.

In other words, React context allows us to share data (state) across our components more easily.

When should you use React context?
React context is great when you are passing data that can be used in any component in your application.

These types of data include:

Theme data (like dark or light mode)
User data (the currently authenticated user)
Location-specific data (like user language or locale)
Data should be placed on React context that does not need to be updated often.

Why? Because context was not made as an entire state management system. It was made to make consuming data easier.

You can think of React context as the equivalent of global variables for our React components.

What problems does React context solve?
React context helps us avoid the problem of props drilling.

Props drilling is a term to describe when you pass props down multiple levels to a nested component, through components that don't need it.

Here is an example of props drilling. In this application, we have access to theme data that we want to pass as a prop to all of our app's components.

As you can see, however, the direct children of App, such as Header, also have to pass the theme data down using props.
